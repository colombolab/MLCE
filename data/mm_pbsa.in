#
#   mm_pbsa allows to calculate (absolute) free energies for one molecular
#     species or a free energy difference according to:
#
#     Receptor + Ligand = Complex, 
#     DeltaG = G(Complex) - G(Receptor) - G(Ligand).
#
#   PREFIX - To the prefix, "{_com, _rec, _lig}.crd.Number" is added during 
#            generation of snapshots as well as during mm_pbsa calculations.
#   PATH - Specifies the location where to store or get snapshots.
#
#   COMPLEX - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.
#   RECEPTOR - Set to 1 if either (absolute) free energy or free energy
#              difference are calculated.
#   LIGAND - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.
#
#   COMPT - parmtop file for the complex (not necessary for option GC).
#   RECPT - parmtop file for the receptor (not necessary for option GC).
#   LIGPT - parmtop file for the ligand (not necessary for option GC).
#
#   GC - Snapshots are generated from trajectories (see below).
#   AS - Residues are mutated during generation of snapshots from trajectories.
#   DC - Decompose the free energies into individual contributions 
#        (only works with MM and GB).
#
#   MM - Calculation of gas phase energies using sander.
#   GB - Calculation of desolvation free energies using the GB models in sander
#        (see below).
#   PB - Calculation of desolvation free energies using delphi (see below).
#        Calculation of nonpolar solvation free energies according to
#        the NPOPT option in pbsa (see below).
#   MS - Calculation of nonpolar contributions to desolvation using molsurf
#        (see below).
#        If MS == 0 and GB == 1, nonpolar contributions are calculated with the
#        LCPO method in sander.
#        If MS == 0 and PB == 1, nonpolar contributions are calculated according
#        the NPOPT option in pbsa (see below).
#   NM - Calculation of entropies with nmode.

@DECOMP 
#
# Energy decomposition parameters (this section is only relevant if DC = 1 above)
#
#   Energy decomposition is performed for gasphase energies, desolvation free
#     energies calculated with GB, and nonpolar contributions to desolvation
#     using the LCPO method.
#   For amino acids, decomposition is also performed with respect to backbone 
#     and sidechain atoms.
#
#   DCTYPE - Values of 1 or 2 yield a decomposition on a per-residue basis,
#            values of 3 or 4 yield a decomposition on a pairwise per-residue
#               basis. For the latter, so far the number of pairs must not 
#               exceed the number of residues in the molecule considered.
#            Values 1 or 3 add 1-4 interactions to bond contributions.
#            Values 2 or 4 add 1-4 interactions to either electrostatic or vdW 
#              contributions.
#
#   COMREC - Residues belonging to the receptor molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   COMLIG - Residues belonging to the ligand molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   RECRES - Residues in the receptor molecule.
#   LIGRES - Residues in the ligand molecule.
#   {COM,REC,LIG}PRI - Residues considered for output.
#   {REC,LIG}MAP - Residues in the complex which are equivalent to the residues
#                  in the receptor molecule or the ligand molecule.
