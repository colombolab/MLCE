* The current development of version 1.3 is 1.3.1, and is distributed with the publication "The Answer Lies in the Energy: How Simple Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations may Hold the Key to Epitope Prediction on the Fully Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein", by Serapian, Marchetti et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2020
* Version 1.3.1 (see also changelog in bin/REBELOT.py):
    - has been modified by Stefano A. Serapian from Version 1.2.3 to accept sugars according to Glycam nomenclature.
    - has only been tested with mode "-m b", and has problems with mode "-m c" and mode "-m m".
    - requires the specially-fused forcefield file leaprc.GLYCAM_06j-1_ff14SB.v18_water.tip3p present in the data/ subfolder
        ยง the above file can be replaced by other fused forcefield files of choice
    - *REQUIRES* an amber-compatible pdb (i.e. it CANNOT handle protein preparation steps present in previous versions).
* Version 1.3.2:
    - has been modified by Stefano A. Serapian and Filippo Marchetti
    - optionally allows the user to invoke a special "--glycan" treatment
    - optionally allows the user to invoke a special "--keep_h" option (e.g. for pdb files originating from MD simulations).
    - *DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY LONGER* an amber-compatible pdb (without the --keep_h option, previous treatment is reinstated).
    - has been tested with mode "-m b", "-m c", and should therefore work with "-m s" and "-m m".
* Further documentation and installation instructions are available in the doc/ subfolder
